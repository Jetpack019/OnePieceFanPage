      <p>In chapter 1056 we saw that Law gave Kid a copy of Kaido’s Road Poneglyph. As Killer examines it he comments
        that if they want to be real contenders in the race for the One Piece then they’re going to ‘have to get serious
        about this task’.</p>

      <h1><span style="color: black">One Piece Theory:</span> <span style="color: white">The Seraphim Project</span>
      </h1>
      <br>
      <p>Just recently, One Piece Chapter 1059 revealed that the SSG are actually genetically enhanced clones with
        Lunarian abilities! However, how did Vegapunk accomplish this?
        <br>
        The identification of Lineage Factors and Bloodline Elements formed the foundation of this technology. All of
        the various components that make up the Seraphim project are built around this discovery. As soon as Vegapunk
        learned about it, he was detained, and MADS was incorporated into the World Government.

      <h1><span style="color: black">One Piece Theory:</span><span style="color: white">The Red Line's biggest secret
          may be revealed via Elbaf myth.</span> </h1>
      <br>
      <p>In addition to a theory about Elbafian lore, Elbaf is indeed approaching. The Little Garden arc, when Giants
        Dorry and Brogy are introduced as the audience's first encounters with the race, provides significant evidence
        in favor of the theory.
        <br>
        Although it is improbable that the Red Line is a gigantic serpent that is dozing, the continent itself is at
        least a representation of the Norse World Serpent. Foreshadowing and symbolism are two of author Eiichiro Oda's
        favorite literary techniques, and CM Renji's hypothesis contains examples of both.
